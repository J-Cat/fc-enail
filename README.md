# fc-enail

This project is inspired by the FC Community and a desire to have a better E-Nail product, with ease of use, advanced features, and wireless connectivity.

## Highlights

* Easy temperature adjustments with rotary dial
* Easy on/off of heater both on device and remotely
* Quick temps from mobile screen to go to a temperature with 1-click
* Save/Load profiles (PID settings) for different devices (can use auto-tune to generate)
* Run scripts for fancy up-temp procedures and the like
* Full mobile access including:
** Remotely start, adjust temperatures, and monitor
** Run scripts
** Manage/create/edit scripts with the script editor (drag/drop GUI)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Omron E5CC-QX2ASM-802
* Raspberry Pi Zero running Raspbian
* misc modules/components - I need to document the components and schematic/assembly instructions and required hardware in detail.  I may eventually provide a pre-built kit for the hardware to make people's lives easier, depending if I can get the circuit board built in such a way to make everything pluggable and quick to assemble.

### Installing

* npm install
* node_modules\.bin\tsc

## Deployment

* copy files to Raspberry Pi
* npm install
* node build/app.js

## Built With

* Typescript
* ReactJS/Redux
* Raspberry Pi
* Omron E5CC-QX2ASM-802
